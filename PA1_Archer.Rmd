This is the first assignment for the Coursera Reproducible Research.  This assignment
consists of the analysis of personal moving activity data that has been collected using monitoring 
devices such as Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, and/or Jawbone Up.



**Loading and preprocessing the data**

1. Load the data
2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
``` {r}
getwd()
setwd("/Users/ArcherJime/Downloads/Archer Folder/Coursera_ReproducibleResearch")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
head(activity)
class(activity$date)
```


**What is mean total number of steps taken per day?**

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
``` {r}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
daysteps <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
``` {r}
# Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(daysteps, breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500), col = "green", xlab="Total number of steps", ylim=c(0,20), main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day (NAs removed)")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps per day
``` {r}
# Mean of the total number of steps per day
mean(daysteps, na.rm = TRUE)
# Median of the total number of steps per day
median(daysteps, na.rm = TRUE)
```


**What is the average daily activity pattern?**

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type ="1") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
``` {r}
# Calculate the average number of steps taken by each interval across all days
avgsteps <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
# Plot a time series for the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days
plot(avgsteps, type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 2,xlab="Time Series Intervals", ylab = "Average Steps", main = "Average Nubmer of Steps Taken Averaged Across All Days")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
``` {r}
# Identify the interval with the maximum number of steps (sort in decreasing order)
sort(avgsteps, decreasing = TRUE)
```


**Imputing missing values**

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
``` {r}
# Calculate the total number of NAs
Total_NA <- sum(is.na(activity))
Total_NA
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
``` {r}
# Identify the index positions of the NAs
na_ind <- which(is.na(activity$steps))
# Create a vector the length of total NAs with the average of steps throughout all the days
meanvec <- rep(mean(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE), times = length(na_ind))
```

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
``` {r}
# Replace missing values (NAs) with the average value of steps 
activity[is.na(activity)] <- meanvec
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

``` {r}
# Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(daysteps, breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500), col = "dark blue", xlab="Total number of steps", ylim=c(0,20), main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day (NAs removed)")

# Calculate the mean total number of steps taken per day
mean(daysteps)
# Calculate the median total number of steps take per day
median(daysteps)
```


**Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?**

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
``` {r}
# Convert dates factor variable to Date 
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
class(activity$date)
# Create a vector of weekdays
weekdays0 <- c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')
# Use '%in%' and 'weekdays' to create a logical vector
activity$Daytype <- factor((weekdays(activity$date) %in% weekdays0), levels=c(FALSE,TRUE), labels=c('weekend', 'weekday'))
head(activity)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

``` {r}
# Load the lattice graphical library
library(lattice)

# Compute the average number of steps taken, averaged across all daytype variable
days_mean <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$Daytype, activity$interval),mean)

# Rename the attributes
names(days_mean) <- c("daytype", "interval", "mean")
head(days_mean)

# Compute the time series plot
xyplot(mean ~ interval | daytype, days_mean, type="l", lwd=1, xlab="Interval", ylab="Average Number of Steps", layout=c(1,2))
```
