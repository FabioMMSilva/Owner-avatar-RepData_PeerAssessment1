```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r scatterplot, fig.height=4}
library(dplyr)
StepsByDay <- summarise(group_by(activityRawData, date), sum(steps))
hist(StepsByDay$`sum(steps)`, breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of the total number of steps by day", xlab ="Total steps by day")
```
