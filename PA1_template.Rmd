## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
# I sum up all steps taken per day
Stepsperday <- aggregate(activity$steps, list(date = activity$date), sum, na.rm=T)

# I prepare a histogram of the total steps taken each day 

hist(Stepsperday$Steps, col="blue",breaks = c(0,2000,4000,6000, 8000,10000,12000,14000,16000,18000,20000,22000,24000,26000),xlab="Numer of steps per day", 
main="Histogram of the total steps taken each day")

#Calculation of the mean and median values
Daystepsmean <- mean(Stepsperday$Steps)
Daystepsmedian <- median(activ2$Steps)

#Add mean and median values to histogram
abline(v=Daystepsmean,col="red")
abline(v=Daystepsmedian,col="yellow")
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
#Calculate average count of steps for each interval
Interstepmean <- aggregate(activity$steps, list(Interval = activity$interval), mean, na.rm=T)
names(Interstepmean) <- c("interval","stpavg")

#Realise plot for relation between Interval and average number of steps 
plot(Interstepmean$interval, Interstepmean$stpavg, type = "l",
xlab = "Intervals", ylab = "Avg number of steps", 
main = "Average steps per 5-min interval", col = "red")
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
