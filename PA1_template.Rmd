### Introduction
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the ‚Äúquantified self‚Äù movement ‚Äì a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minuteintervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

### Data Source
The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the web site below:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip

### Description of Variables
The variables included in this dataset are:

* steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as ùôΩùô∞)
* date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
* interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

### Data file
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

* The file is named activity.csv and it is contained within the zipped file called repdata-data-activity.zip

### R Code sections and results addressing the questions re shown below:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
## Load libraries
library("dplyr")
library("lattice")
library(knitr)

## Download and unzip the data from the url:
fileDirectory <- getwd()
zipedDataFile <- "repdata-data-activity.zip"
dataFile <- "activity.csv"
if (!file.exists(zipedDataFile)){
  fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
  download.file(fileURL, zipedDataFile, method="curl")
}

## Check if downloaded zipped file has been unzipped. If not, the file is unzipped
if (!file.exists(dataFile)){ 
  unzip(zipedDataFile) 
}

## Get Activity Data information and load data into data frame
filePath <- paste0(fileDirectory,"/",dataFile)
activityData <- read.csv(filePath)
activityData <- tbl_df(activityData)
head(activityData)

## Question 1: What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
## 1.1: Calculation of Total Number of Steps Per Day
activityWithoutNullSteps <- filter(activityData,!is.na(steps))
totalStepsPerDay <- aggregate(activityWithoutNullSteps$steps, by=list(activityWithoutNullSteps$date), FUN = sum)
names(totalStepsPerDay) <- c("date", "totalSteps")

## 1.2: Plot the Histogram of the "Total Number of Steps" recorded per day with NA values removed
barplot(height=totalStepsPerDay$totalSteps, names.arg=totalStepsPerDay$date, ylim=c(0, 25000), xlab="Date", ylab="Total Steps Per Day")

## 1.3: Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
meanStepsPerDay <- mean(totalStepsPerDay$totalSteps)       ## Mean of Total Number of Steps per Day
medianStepsPerDay <- median(totalStepsPerDay$totalSteps)   ## Median of Total Number of Steps per Day

meanSteps <- (paste0("Mean of Total Number of Steps per Day = ",meanStepsPerDay))
medianSteps <- (paste0("Median of Total Number of Steps per Day = ",medianStepsPerDay))
meanSteps
medianSteps


## Question 2: What is the Average Daily Activity Pattern?
## 2.1: Make a time series plot (i.e. ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé = "ùöï") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
meanIntervalPerDay <- aggregate(activityWithoutNullSteps$steps, by=list(activityWithoutNullSteps$interval), FUN = mean)
names(meanIntervalPerDay) <- c("interval", "mean")
plot(meanIntervalPerDay$interval, meanIntervalPerDay$mean, type="l", col="brown", lwd=2, xlab="Interval (Minutes)", ylab="Average Number of Steps", 
     main="Time-Series of the Average Number of Steps per Intervals")

## 2.2: Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
avgIntervalWithMaxSteps <- meanIntervalPerDay$interval[which.max(meanIntervalPerDay$mean)]
intervalWithMaximumSteps <- paste0("The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum of steps, on average across all days, is ", avgIntervalWithMaxSteps)
intervalWithMaximumSteps

## Question 3: Imputing Missing Values
## 3.1: Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
totalRowsWithMissingValues <- nrow(activityData) - nrow(activityWithoutNullSteps)
totalNumMissingVals <- paste0("The total number of missing values in the dataset is ",totalRowsWithMissingValues)
totalNumMissingVals

## 3.2: Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be
##      sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc
##      The strategy selected by me to replace missing values in the dataset is to replace NAs with the Mean Number of Steps
##      per Day

## 3.3: Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
rowsWithNAs <- which(is.na(activityData$steps))                                        ## locate row positions with NA values
vectorOfMeanSteps <- rep(mean(activityData$steps, na.rm=TRUE), times=length(rowsWithNAs))   ## Create a vector of means
activityData[rowsWithNAs, "steps"] <- vectorOfMeanSteps
newActivityData <- select(activityData,steps,date,interval)
head(newActivityData)

## 3.4: Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number
##      of stepken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the
##      impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

newTotalStepsPerDay <- aggregate(newActivityData$steps, by=list(newActivityData$date), FUN = sum)
names(newTotalStepsPerDay) <- c("date", "totalSteps")
barplot(height=newTotalStepsPerDay$totalSteps, names.arg=newTotalStepsPerDay$date, ylim=c(0, 25000), xlab="Date", ylab="Total Steps Per Day")
newMeanStepsPerDay <- mean(newTotalStepsPerDay$totalSteps)       ## New Mean of Total Number of Steps per Day
newMedianStepsPerDay <- median(newTotalStepsPerDay$totalSteps)   ## New Median of Total Number of Steps per Day
newMean <- (paste0("New Mean of Total Number of Steps per Day = ",newMeanStepsPerDay))
newMedian <- (paste0("New Median of Total Number of Steps per Day = ",newMedianStepsPerDay))
newMean
newMedian

## These values did not differ greatly from the estimates from the first part of the assignment.
## There is not a significant impact of imputing the missing values.

## Question 4: Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

## 4.1: Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels ‚Äì ‚Äúweekday‚Äù and ‚Äúweekend‚Äù indicating whether a given
##      date is a weekday or weekend day.
newActivityData <- mutate(newActivityData, dayofweek = weekdays(as.Date(date)))
newActivityData <- mutate(newActivityData,daytype =ifelse(dayofweek %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"), "Weekend", ifelse(dayofweek %in% c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"), "Weekday", NA)))
head(newActivityData)

## 4.2: Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé = "ùöï") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average
##      number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the
##      GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated dat
newStepsIntervalMean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daytype, newActivityData, mean)
panelPlotByDayType <- xyplot(steps ~ interval | daytype, data = newStepsIntervalMean, layout=c(2,1), type='l', xlab="Interval", ylab="Avg Number of Steps")
print(panelPlotByDayType)

## There are differences in the patterns observed between Weekdays and Weekends 
```
