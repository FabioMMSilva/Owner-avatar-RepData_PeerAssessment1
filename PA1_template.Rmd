## Loading and preprocessing the data

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

StepsPerDay <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

StepsPerInterval <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(as.numeric(names(StepsPerInterval)), 
     StepsPerInterval, 
     xlab = "Interval", 
     ylab = "Steps", 
     main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern", 
     type = "l")

## Imputing missing values

NA.vals <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

activity.imputed$day <- ifelse(weekdays(as.Date(activity.imputed$date)) == "Saturday" | weekdays(as.Date(activity.imputed$date)) == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")
