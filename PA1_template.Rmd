## Loading and preprocessing the data
1. Loading the data
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "numeric"))
head(activity)
names(activity)
2. Process/transform the data Into a format suitable for your analysis
library(lattice)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. Mean and median of total steps taken per day
StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE) 
hist(StepsTotal$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
mean(StepsTotal$steps)
median(StepsTotal$steps)
2.Total number of steps taken per day
steps <- rep(NA, 61)
day <- rep("NA", 61)
stepsday <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = T)
 length(stepsday)
[1] 61
for (i in 1:61) {
+     steps[i] <- stepsday[[i]]
+     day[i] <- names(stepsday)[i]
+ }
 
 df <- data.frame(day, steps)
 head(df)
         day steps
1 2012-10-01     0
2 2012-10-02   126
3 2012-10-03 11352
4 2012-10-04 12116
5 2012-10-05 13294
6 2012-10-06 15420
3. Making a histogram of it.
hist(df$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Making of a time series of plot of the 5 minute interval(x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, average number of steps taken, averaged across all days(y-axis)
time_series <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(row.names(time_series), time_series, type = "l", xlab = "5-min interval", ylab = "Average across all Days", main = "average number of steps taken", col = "red")
2. Make a 5-min interval an average of across all daya in dataset.
 max_interval <- which.max(time_series)
 names(max_interval)
[1] "835"

## Imputing missing values
1. calculate and report te total number of missing values in the datset
activity_NA <- sum(is.na(activity))
 activity_NA
[1] 2304
2. Devise a strategy for filling all the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-min interval, etc
 StepsAverage <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean)
 fillNA <- numeric()
 for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
+     obs <- activity[i, ]
+     if (is.na(obs$steps)) {
+         steps <- subset(StepsAverage, interval == obs$interval)$steps
+     } else {
+         steps <- obs$steps
+     }
+     fillNA <- c(fillNA, steps)
+ }
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
new_activity <- activity
 new_activity$steps <- fillNA
 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
  StepsTotal2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = new_activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
 hist(StepsTotal2$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
 
 and the mean and median of the data is
 mean(stepsTotal2$steps)
[1] 10766.19
 median(stepsTotal2$steps)
[1] 10766.19
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
1. create a new factor variable in the dataset with the two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
day <- weekdays(activity$date)
 daylevel <- vector()
 for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
+     if (day[i] == "Saturday") {
+         daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
+     } else if (day[i] == "Sunday") {
+         daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
+     } else {
+         daylevel[i] <- "Weekday"
+     }
+ }
 activity$daylevel <- daylevel
 activity$daylevel <- factor(activity$daylevel)
 stepsByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daylevel, data = activity, mean)
 names(stepsByDay) <- c("interval", "daylevel", "steps")
 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
 xyplot(steps ~ interval | daylevel, stepsByDay, type = "l", layout = c(1,2), xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
