## Loading and preprocessing the data
setwd("~/Reproducible Data Project 1")
> activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
> activity$day <- weekdays(as.Date(activity$date))
> activity$DateTime<- as.POSIXct(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
> 
> ##pulling data without nas
> clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Sum steps by day, create Histogram, and calculate mean and median
## summarizing total steps per date
> sumTable <- aggregate(activity$steps ~ activity$date, FUN=sum, )
> colnames(sumTable)<- c("Date", "Steps")
> ## Creating the historgram of total steps per day
> hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day")

> ## Mean of Steps
> as.integer(mean(sumTable$Steps))
[1] 10766
## Median of Steps
> as.integer(median(sumTable$Steps))
[1] 10765
The Mean is 10766 and the Median is 10765.
## Average Daily Pattern
##pulling data without nas
clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
> 
> ##create average number of steps per interval
> intervalTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))
> 
> ##Create line plot of average number of steps per interval
> p <- ggplot(intervalTable, aes(x=interval, y=Avg), xlab = "Interval", ylab="Average Number of Steps")
> p + geom_line()+xlab("Interval")+ylab("Average Number of Steps")+ggtitle("Average Number of Steps per Interval")
> ##Maximum steps by interval
> maxSteps <- max(intervalTable$Avg)
> ##Which interval contains the maximum average number of steps
> intervalTable[intervalTable$Avg==maxSteps,1]
[1] 835


The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the data set, containing the maximum number of steps is 835.



## Imputing missing values
My strategy for filling in NAs will be to substitute the missing steps with the average 5-minute interval based on the day of the week.


##Number of NAs in original data set
> nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])
[1] 2304
> ## Create the average number of steps per weekday and interval
> avgTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval, day), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))
> 
> ## Create dataset with all NAs for substitution
> nadata<- activity[is.na(activity$steps),]
> ## Merge NA data with average weekday interval for substitution
> newdata<-merge(nadata, avgTable, by=c("interval", "day"))
> ## Reorder the new substituded data in the same format as clean data set
> newdata2<- newdata[,c(6,4,1,2,5)]

> colnames(newdata2)<- c("steps", "date", "interval", "day", "DateTime")
> ##Merge the NA averages and non NA data together
> mergeData <- rbind(clean, newdata2)
> ##Create sum of steps per date to compare with step 1
> sumTable2 <- aggregate(mergeData$steps ~ mergeData$date, FUN=sum, )
> colnames(sumTable2)<- c("Date", "Steps")

## Creating the histogram of total steps per day, categorized by data set to show impact
> hist(sumTable2$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="Black")
> hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="Grey", add=T)
> legend("topright", c("Imputed Data", "Non-NA Data"), fill=c("black", "grey") )

## Mean of Steps with NA data taken care of
> as.integer(mean(sumTable2$Steps))
[1] 10821
> ## Median of Steps with NA data taken care of
> as.integer(median(sumTable2$Steps))
[1] 11015


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
The new mean of the imputed data is 10821 steps compared to the old mean of 10766 steps. That creates a difference of 55 steps on average per day.
The new median of the imputed data is 11015 steps compared to the old median of 10765 steps. That creates a difference of 250 steps for the median. However, the overall shape of the distribution has not changed.

## Summarize data by interval and type of day
> intervalTable2 <- ddply(mergeData, .(interval, DayCategory), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))
> ##Plot data in a panel plot
> xyplot(Avg~interval|DayCategory, data=intervalTable2, type="l",  layout = c(1,2),
+        main="Average Steps per Interval Based on Type of Day", 
+        ylab="Average Number of Steps", xlab="Interval")
