### Welcome  

Hi,  
Welcome to my Course Project / Peer Assessment Assignment.  
The purpose of this work is to produce a R Markdown document with all the code needed to answer the required questions.  
  
This code was prepared in the following environment:
 - OS: Linux x86_64 (3.12.15-pclos1)
 - R/RStudio: 3.0.2 / 99.9.9, with the following packages:
   - tools (3.0.2)
   - knitr (1.6)
  
I'll start by preparing the environment to always display the code chunks in the final html file and also to load required packages.  
```{r Setup}
library(tools)
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, results="markup")

```

## Loading and preprocessing the data


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
