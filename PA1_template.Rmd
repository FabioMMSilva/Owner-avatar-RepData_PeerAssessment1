mydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
###Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
totalsteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=mydata, FUN=sum)
qplot(date, data=totalsteps, geom="bar", weight=steps, ylab="steps")
```

###Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(totalsteps$steps)
median(totalsteps$steps)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
