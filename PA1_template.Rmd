## Loading and preprocessing the data

unzip("activity.zip")

mydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
totalsteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=mydata, FUN=sum)

qplot(date, data=totalsteps, geom="bar", weight=steps, ylab="steps")


#Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
mean(totalsteps$steps)
median(totalsteps$steps)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
