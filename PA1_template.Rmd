## Loading and preprocessing the data

act <- read.csv("activity.csv")


### Change Date format to column with date type

act$date <- as.Date(act$date , format = "%Y-%m-%d")

### Create total steps per day

act.day <- aggregate(act$steps, by =list (act$date), sum)

### Create total steps per interval

act.int <- aggregate(act$steps, by=list (act$interval, sum, na.rm=TRUE, na.action=NULL))

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### Make a histogram of total number of steps taken each day

hist(act.day$steps),
  main = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps Take Each Day",
  xlab= "Total Number of Steps Taken"
  
### Mean number of steps taken each day  

act.mean <- mean(act.day$steps, na.rm=TRUE)

### Median number of steps taken each day

act.median <- median(act.day$steps, na.rm=TRUE)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
