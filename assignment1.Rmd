## Loading and preprocessing the data

The dataset is [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip). Download the data file, unzip it and put it into your working directory. Loading the data using the following R code:

```{R}
D<- read.csv("D:/COURSERA_Reproducible_Research/Assignment1/repdata-data-activity/activity.csv")
head(D)
```
For the following problems, we ignore the missing values in the dataset as:
```{R}
Data <- D[!is.na(D[,1]),]

head(Data)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part, we ignore the missing values in the dataset. The total number of steps taken per day could be performed via:
```{R}

datesSet <- union(Data[,2],Data[,2])
totalNumberOfSteps=1:length(datesSet)

for (index in 1: length(datesSet))
{
	subData <- Data[Data[,2]==datesSet[index],]
	totalNumberOfSteps[index] <- sum(subData[,1])
}

totalNumberOfSteps

```

The histogram of the total number of steps taken each day is:
```{R}

hist(totalNumberOfSteps)
```

The mean and median of the total number of steps could be obtained by:
```{R}
summary(totalNumberOfSteps)
```

From above, the mean is 10770 and the median is 10760.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
